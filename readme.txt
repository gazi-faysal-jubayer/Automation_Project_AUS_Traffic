1. At first, you need to install python in your operating system.

2.  For the very first opening, open terminal at this file directory and run
"pip install -r requirements.txt" command to install all the python packages.
If you install all the packages once, you need not to run this command everytime
unless you uninstall the packages. 

3.  To open the programme, open terminal at the file directory and run
python <file_name>
[eg. python trafic.py]
