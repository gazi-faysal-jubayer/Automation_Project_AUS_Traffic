### 2. Input year & month (Ex: 202301--> year=2023 & month=01):
Input the year and month of the traffic volume data you like to summarise. 
For example,
> 202306
### 3. input date (two digits):
Input the date in two digits of the traffic volume data you like to summarise. 
For example,
> 15
### 4. Input Site Number:
Input signal site number.
For example,
> 190
### 5. Input Site Name (Ex:Lonsdale Street/Foster St):

### 7. Output file name:
Write the Traffic volume summary file.
For example,

### 9. North approach specific turns (e.g. LT, TH, RT, UTâ€¦..):
Input one allowable turn on the north approach.
For example,
> TH
### 10. 'Detectors' Nos. for this turn:
Input detector numbers for the TH turn
For example,
> 6, 7
### 11. Any specific turns and detector numbers left(y/n):
If there is more turn on the north approach, write y and enter. It's not case sensitivity.
